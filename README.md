# BI-Analyst-Delivery-Platform-Insights-Project
Project Overview: As a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst, I was tasked with analyzing a dataset related to individual deliveries completed on a delivery platform over a specific period. 
The goal was to surface valuable insights that would aid senior leadership in making informed business decisions. This project focused on understanding key business metrics and trends,
identifying potential opportunities for optimization, and generating actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

Key Responsibilities:

Business Understanding:
Collaborated with senior leadership to understand business objectives and questions, such as identifying delivery performance trends, customer satisfaction drivers, and areas for operational improvements. 
This provided context for the analysis and helped focus the data exploration process.

Data Understanding & Preprocessing:
Utilized Python for initial data cleaning and exploration, ensuring there were no missing values in the dataset.
During this stage, I identified several outliers, but chose not to remove them as they represented 80% of the data, which seemed integral to the overall analysis. 
I ensured that data integrity was maintained and performed statistical tests to understand the distribution and trends within the dataset.

Pattern Recognition & Statistical Analysis:
Applied correlation techniques to identify relationships between key data points, such as delivery times, distances, and driving times.
This helped uncover deeper insights about operational inefficiencies and customer behavior. 
For example, I identified that distance of delivery from restaurant to customer correlated closely with time driving from restaurant to customer, which suggested a potential area for improvement.

Visualization & Reporting: Using Tableau, I created a series of visualizations to make the data insights accessible and easily interpretable for senior leadership. 
These visualizations focused on key performance metrics, average delivery time, and relationships between various factors. I also included findings and recommendations for potential business improvements based on my analysis.

Key Insights & Recommendations:

Delivery Efficiency: The analysis revealed that certain couriers were significantly more efficient than others, suggesting opportunities for optimizing delivery assignments.
Time vs. Distance Relationship: There was a strong correlation between longer delivery times and higher distances, which could be addressed by refining delivery scheduling and routes.
By combining business context with data analysis, I was able to provide actionable insights that contributed to strategic decision-making for the platform's future growth and operational efficiency.
